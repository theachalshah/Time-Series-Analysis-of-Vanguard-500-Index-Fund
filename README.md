# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Vanguard-500-Index-Fund

Legendary investor Warren Buffett has recommended index funds as a haven for savings for the later years of life. Rather than picking out individual stocks for investment, he has said, it makes more sense for the average investor to buy all of the S&P 500 companies at the low cost an index fund offers.

Personally as someone who is in 20’s I find this investment very attractive. Rather than picking out individual stocks for investment, it makes more sense for the average investor to buy all of the S&P 500 companies at the low cost an index fund offers. Index funds seek to match the risk and return of the market, on the theory that in the long-term, the market will outperform any single investment. With time the economy of the country and financial ability of the people is enhanced, this leads the flow of money into top public companies of an index. As a result, both the index and unit cost of index funds gradually increments in the long term. Therefore, say in 20 years one will have not only savings but more returns on savings given by any bank in the world and if you are worried about another crash or pandemic, the historical data depicts index always bounces back.
